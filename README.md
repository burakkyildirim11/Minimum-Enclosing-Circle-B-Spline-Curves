# Minimum-Enclosing-Circle-B-Spline-Curves
 A program that draws the minimum enclosing circle and B-Spline curve that contains the entered coordinates.
 
 
 # About the Projects

Spline curves are a strip used to create a smooth curve around a series of points. Definition of the problem the minimum enclosing circle problem is also known as the least circle problem.
- Given n points in a 2-dimensional plane with integer coordinates by the desired user in the project, you are prompted to draw a circle with a minimum perimeter radius containing all points.
- You are asked to draw the curve that passes the closest of the given n points.
- You are asked to calculate the radius and center of the circle you are drawing.
